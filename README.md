# F√∂rankrad Konferensen Project README

## Introduction

Welcome to the F√∂rankrad Konferensen project! This README will guide you through the setup, technologies used, and how to contribute to the project.

## Project Overview

This project is specifically tailored for the F√∂rankrad Konferensen event, hosted by Pingst Church V√§stra Fr√∂lunda. It is built using Next.js and deployed on Vercel. The platform enables attendees to access event information, make bookings, and receive confirmation emails.

## Technologies Used

Next.js: Next.js is a React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites.
Vercel: Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, perfect for deploying Next.js projects.
Google Sheets: We utilize Google Sheets as our content management system and for storing bookings.
Resend: Resend is used to send confirmation emails to users who make bookings.
Tailwind: CSS framework. 
DaisyUi: Library using tailwind for styled components.

### Setup Requirements
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:

Google Service Account: You'll need a Google service account with access to the necessary Google Sheets containing information and permissions.
Sheet IDs: Obtain the sheet IDs containing the required information, and grant permission to your client email in the service account.
Resend Key and DNS Configuration: Obtain a Resend API key for sending confirmation emails and configure DNS for the domain.
Domain Configuration: Configure the DNS for the domain where the project will be deployed.
Project Structure

/app: Contains Next.js app files for routing and rendering.
/components: Contains reusable React components.
/public: Stores static assets such as images.
/google-sheets-api contains the logic for retrieving information and set information in the sheets.
/actions.ts is a file with server actions.

The website fetches data from Google Sheets. When fetching images, only the ID is retrieved. It's the user's responsibility to input the ID into Google Sheets.
